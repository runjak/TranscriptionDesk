## Project Plan ##
* all milestones require extended testing!

# phase one #

* Interface Mockup
* Database Mockup
    * Tack timestamps on all things where possible
    * Build with URNs in mind (prefixes are potentially helpful for SELECT, etc. later)
* Build Omeka service provider
    * Should use Omeka instance to query it for images and their metadata.
    * There will be collections with items in them.
    * Each item contains numerous images and some metadata.
    * Important metadata are:
        * Copyright
        * Public: Boolean
        * Featured: Boolean
    * Case dependency on metadata:
        * Public && Featured: Display even for not logged in users
        * Â¬Public && Featured: Display only for logged in users
        * else: act as if it doesn't exist
* User Registration Process and Login plus Personal Page
    * maybe use github, facebook, google oauth process to avoid password storage

# First Milestone #
* working website mockup with registration

# phase two #

* implement URN process as Thomas recommended:
```
urn:cite:olg:leiden_vlf123_0001.tif@<double>,<double>,<double>,<double>
                                  +@<double>,<double>,<double>,<double>
                                  +leiden_vlf123_0002.tif@<double>,<double>,<double>,<double>
```
    *  ```+``` adds a new rectangle.
    * rectangle coordinates are initiates with ```@```,
    * ```:``` separates cite URN suffixes
    *for Transcriptions:
    ---
    Append timestamp and username for Transcription.
    ```
    urn:tdesk:usertimestamp
    ```
    *```timestamp === ddddmmddhhmmss```,
* areas of interest
    * display file pictures in frontend
    * allow marking of areas of interest
    * add a category to area of interest, fixed number and type of categories
    * save them in backend and user profile
    * allow voting of areas of interest
        * -/+ System, at +5 the area of interest is believed to be okay
    * implement progress bar

    * implement input of mufi characters in markdown
