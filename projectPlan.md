## Project Plan ##
* all milestones require extended testing!

# phase one #

* Interface Mockup
* Database Mockup
    * Tack timestamps on all things where possible
    * Build with URNs in mind (prefixes are potentially helpful for SELECT, etc. later)
* Build Omeka service provider
    * Should use Omeka instance to query it for images and their metadata.
    * There will be collections with items in them.
    * Each item contains numerous images and some metadata.
    * Important metadata are:
        * Copyright
        * Public: Boolean
        * Featured: Boolean
    * Case dependency on metadata:
        * Public && Featured: Display even for not logged in users
        * Â¬Public && Featured: Display only for logged in users
        * else: act as if it doesn't exist
* User Registration Process and Login plus Personal Page
    * maybe use github, facebook, google oauth process to avoid password storage
